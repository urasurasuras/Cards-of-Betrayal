Description:
Each player has 5 cards at a time in their hand, except for the starting player which has 6. At the start of the game, the player with 6 cards is supposed to discard one of their cards face up in a pile to their right-hand-side. The turns go counter-clockwise, and at the start of each player’s turn, they are supposed to draw a new card from the middle or pick up the top discarded card from the discard pile of the previous player, then discard one to their right-hand-side and so on.
